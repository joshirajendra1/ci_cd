Deploy your ML model with AWS Lambda and use it for model inference

Please follow steps below for deploying the score prediction model.

Data for creating the model is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?select=StudentsPerformance.csv

1. First run docker build command to create container image 
	docker build -t 'dockername' Dockerfile

2. Deploy the docker container in AWS-Lambda with command below: 

	docker run -d -p 8080:8080 dockername

3. Test the deployment with curl command below:

	curl -XPOST "http://localhost:8080/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations" -d 
	"{\"gender\":\"female\",\"race/ethnicity\":\"group E\",\"parental level of education\":\"master's degree\", 
	\"lunch\":\"standard\", \"test preparation course\": \"completed\"}"
	
	
Note: I used curl for quick test; One can use postman for testing the successful deployment in AWS Lambda.
